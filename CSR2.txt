1. Implementation
    This CSR implement the CSR-1

2. Terminology

    The Chain Of Responsibility will be called CORDP (i.e. chain of responsibility design pattern).

3. Definition

    A CORDP can be represented as a simply linked chain where each elements are the same class and will give their
result to the next element while a next one exist.

    To enhance reusability, a data transfert object MUST be given to the CORDS since a specialised implementation
is not defined from interfaces.

4. CORDP Structure

    4.1. CORDP Data transfer object
    
    The CORDP generic data transfer object SHOULD implement an interface that allow to set and get a set of attributes.
By this way the link of the chains will be allowed to work with the same data transfer object.

    4.2. CORDP Links
    
    The CORDP links MUST implement a method to check the next link existance. This method MAY be called 'hasNext'.
    The CORDP links MUST implement a method to process a request. This method MAY be called 'run'.
    The CORDP links MUST implement a method to give the request to the next element. This method MAY be called 'next'.

    The CORDP links SHOULD implement a method to set next element. This method MAY be called 'setNext'.

    The CORDP links MAY implement a method to validate the support state of the request. This method MAY be called
'support'.
